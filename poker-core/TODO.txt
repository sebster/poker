* Check preflop odds calculators for bounds checks (make sure they don't happen).
* Make postflop odds calculator for omaha.

* CardSet refactor
  * first() and last() static method rename so they don't collide/get confused with first()/last() instance methods?
  * find good names for

  	* first()
  	* last()
  * instance control policy?
