		<h1>Tournament Equity</h1>
	
		<p>When you buy into a $100+$9 10-player SNG with 1000 starting chips and a standard 5:3:2 prize structure,
		you effectively exchange $100 for 2000 in chips (paying $9 to the house for the privilege of playing). It
		seems then that each chip is worth $100/1000 = $0.10. However, if you win the tournament by winning all 10,000
		chips in play, you only get paid $500, and so each chip now only seems to be worth $500/10000 = $0.05! Where did
		the missing money go?
		Well, the players who busted out in second and third place won money from the prize pool even though they
		had 0 chips left. If this was a winner-take-all tournament, you would get paid the entire $1000 and each chip would
		still be worth $1000/10000 = $0.10. But in tournaments with a different prize structure, the chips do not have a
		constant monetary value! This is where tournament equity comes in.
		</p>
	
		<p><i>Tournament equity</i> is your "rightful" share of the prize pool. It is the amount of money you win <i>on
		average</i>, or mathmatically:
		<pre>
  equity = E(1st) + E(2nd) + E(3rd) + ...
         = P(1st) * (1st prize) + P(2nd) * (2nd prize) + P(3rd) * (3rd prize) + ...</pre>
	    </p>
	    
	    <p>     
	    In the above SNG, assuming that all players have equal skill, your tournament equity will be exactly 1/10 of the
	    prize pool or $100, because every player has the same equity and the total equity must add up to $1000. Another
	    way to calculate this is by noticing that everybody is equally likely to finish in 1st place (since only luck plays
	    a role), and idem for 2nd and 3rd place. Thus your probability of finishing 1st is 1/10, 2nd is 1/10, and 3rd is 1/10.
	    Your tournament equity, calculated as above, is:
	    
		<pre>
  equity = 1/10 * $500 + 1/10 * $300 + 1/10 * $200 = $50 + $30 + $20 = $100</pre>
	    </p>
	
		<p>Of course not every player has the same skill. If a player is better than the average player in a tournament,
		he has a higher than average equity. If he is worse than average, his equity is lower. The sum of all the equities
		will still always equal the total amount in the prize pool (equity does not disappear).
		<p>
		 
		<p>When playing tournaments, the only thing we care about in the end, is how much money we win on average. Thus we
		want to make moves that increase our tournament equity. But how do we calculate our equity based on the number of
		chips players have? One answer is using a model called the Independent Chip Model, or ICM.
